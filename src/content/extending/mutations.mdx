## About Mutations

Mutations in GraphQL signify that some data is changing. Other than the keyword mutation, they are _technically_ identical to Queries.

## Register new Mutation

`@todo: Document how to do this`

## Extend existing mutations

Extending mutation for post

```
        /**
        		 * Run an action after the additional data has been updated. This is a great spot to hook into to
        		 * update additional data related to postObjects, such as setting relationships, updating additional postmeta,
        		 * or sending emails to Kevin. . .whatever you need to do with the postObject.
        		 *
        		 * @param int           $post_id              The ID of the postObject being mutated
        		 * @param array         $input                The input for the mutation
        		 * @param \WP_Post_Type $post_type_object     The Post Type Object for the type of post being mutated
        		 * @param string        $mutation_name        The name of the mutation (ex: create, update, delete)
        		 * @param AppContext    $context              The AppContext passed down to all resolvers
        		 * @param ResolveInfo   $info                 The ResolveInfo passed down to all resolvers
        		 * @param string        $intended_post_status The intended post_status the post should have according to the mutation input
        		 * @param string        $default_post_status  The default status posts should use if an intended status wasn't set
         */

		function graphql_register_edit_mutation( $post_id, $input, $mutation_name, $context, $info ) {
		        // Consider other sanitization if necessary and validation such as which
                // user role/capability should be able to insert this value, etc.
        		if ( ! empty( $input['example'] ) ) {
        			update_post_meta( $post_id, 'example', $input['example'] );
        		}
        	}

Extending mutation for user

```


        /**
        		 * Run an action after the additional data has been updated. This is a great spot to hook into to
        		 * update additional data related to users, such as setting relationships, updating additional usermeta,
        		 * or sending emails to Kevin... whatever you need to do with the userObject.
        		 *
        		 * @param int         $user_id       The ID of the user being mutated
        		 * @param array       $input         The input for the mutation
        		 * @param string      $mutation_name The name of the mutation (ex: create, update, delete)
        		 * @param AppContext  $context       The AppContext passed down the resolve tree
        		 * @param ResolveInfo $info          The ResolveInfo passed down the Resolve Tree
        */

        add_action( 'graphql_user_object_mutation_update_additional_data', 'graphql_register_user_mutation', 10, 5 );

        function graphql_register_user_mutation( $user_id, $input, $mutation_name, $context, $info ) {
        		if ( isset( $input['hobbies'] ) ) {
        			// Consider other sanitization if necessary and validation such as which
        			// user role/capability should be able to insert this value, etc.
        			update_user_meta( $user_id, 'hobbies', $input['hobbies'] );
        		}
        }
